                          After many years of working outside of the area, I’m
                          so happy to return to my hometown of Glendale, where I
                          can share my passion for what I do. I love meeting
                          people, creating healthy smiles, and helping people
                          feel good about themselves. I’ve treated so many
                          patients who tell me that they don’t know how to
                          smile, or always cover their mouths when they do,
                          because they don’t like how their teeth look. It’s so
                          fulfilling, after treatment, to hear those patients
                          say that they now feel more confident, not just in
                          their smiles, but also in themselves.

                          My journey to becoming an orthodontist started when my
                          aunt, the orthodontist, determined that I was ready
                          for braces at the age of ten. I was amazed at how my
                          teeth were getting more aligned– it was like magic! I
                          decided that I wanted to help people in this way when
                          I got older.&nbsp; To that end, I attended UCLA, where
                          I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a degree in
                          psychobiology.&nbsp; I went on to earn my DDS degree
                          at UCLA’s School of Dentistry, where I was awarded the
                          Dean’s Scholarship, and was in the top 10% of my
                          class.&nbsp; My residency took me across the country
                          to Pennsylvania for three years, where I received my
                          certificate in Orthodontics and Dentofacial
                          Orthopedics at the University of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;
                          While there, I earned my master’s degree in dental
                          science and was awarded the Dean’s Scholarship for
                          Excellence in Research.
